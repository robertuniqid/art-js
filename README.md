art-js
======

Art is a Javascript Framework going by the concept Action -> Response -> Trigger.

This is a work in progress framework.It is written in vanilla JS, jQuery is included for the Bootstrap.

I've started this framework, because I felt like having a JS framework similar to Zend 1 structure.

No documentation is provided at this state.

In case you want to try it out, the only configuration you need to do is within the index.html, set the "base" href to the proper url.
